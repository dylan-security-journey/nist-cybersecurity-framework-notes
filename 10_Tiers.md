Tier 1 (partial)

Tier 2 (Risk Informed)

Tier 3 (Repeatable)

## CSF Tiers for Cybersecurity Risk Governance and Management

Tiers used to characterize current or desired level in practices based on CSF Function or Category

Governance practices (GOVERN)

Management practices (Identify, protect, detect, respond, recover)

Tier 1 (Partial): Risk governance: ad-hoc approach, prioritization not guided, Risk management: awareness of risk limited, case-by-case approach, lack of policies

Tier 2 (Risk Informed): Risk governance: risk recognized but managing them not established, prioritization based on threats, Risk management: evaluations no repeatable, aware of risk associated with suppliers but they don't act consistently

Tier 3 (Repeatable): Risk governance: formally approved and policies, defined procedures, practices updated, Risk management: accurately monitored, communication across all areas, suppliers included in risk strategies, continuous reviews and risks formally

Tier 4 (Adaptive): Risk governance: policies in place for potential events, budgets based on predicted risk, mission objectives can be changed quickly from monitored activities, Risk management: adapt practices according to previous activities, continuous improvement to evolving landscape, real-time data from suppliers

## Selecting Tiers

Selected tier should represent holistic view of risk management, refer to governance and risk management as needed, understand current threats/vulnerabilities, budget/resources

Tiers are meant to guide risk governance and management and not replace

## Cybersecurity Risk Management Communication

Align strategies with organizational goals through communication, shared understanding between different stakeholders, open-ended conversations to deepen understanding, training sessions, valuable feedback, direct risk reporting

## Cybersecurity Risk Management Integration

Collaboration between different units, risk acceptance levels

## Component Communication and Integration

Framework Core: Shared understanding, clear communication of goals

Implementation Tiers: Clear expectation, consistent approach

Profiles: effective alignment, documentation in unified risk management

Cybersecurity and Privacy Risk Relationship

Risk management addresses privacy risk like data breaches, security measures impact individual privacy (Ex. Patient health information)
