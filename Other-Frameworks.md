## Privacy and Risk Management Framework

Identify privacy risk, implements measures to mitigate risk, continuously monitor & adjust

Privacy Risk Management: Identify risk, analyze, evaluate, treat

Privacy by Design: Proactive not reactive, privacy as default, privacy embedded, full functionality

Strategic Implementation: develop plan, implement, monitor, adjustments

Law and Regulatory Compliance: requirements, ensure compliance, updates to laws, documentation

Risk Assessment Integration: Integrate assessments, conduct regular intervals, update, use assessments

## Supply Chain Related Definitions

Supply Chain: connected network of resources, sourcing

Supply Chain Risk (SRM): dangers from suppliers, vulnerabilities

Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM): mitigating risk associated with interconnected nature of ICT/OT

## Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Overview

Management: mitigate risk associated with supply chain

Proactive Approach: Anticipate potential risk through monitoring, train employees

Key Considerations: internal and external threats to supply chain, likelihood

Globalization and Outsourcing: potential internal and external threats

Technological Advancements: stay ahead of risk and adapt to changes

## Benefits of C-SCRM

Mitigating risk early, cost savings by avoiding disruptions, better positioned

Resilience: Quick recovery, staying ahead

Stakeholder Confidence and Trust: Reputation to its success, stronger relationships

Sustainability: economic sustainability and avoid financial losses, ethical practices, environmental friendly practices 

## C-SCRM and NIST CSF 2.0

Improve communication, secure data and operations, decision-making process alignment, vendor assessments

## Emerging Technologies Risks

New technology brings new risks, security measures must be implemented

## Effective Risk Communication and Continuous Improvement

Communicate risks to all stakeholders, balance benefits of adopting emerging technologies

## Understanding the AI Risk Management Framework

Integrate trustworthiness consideration through lifecycle of AI, protection of individual rights

## AI RMF Characteristics

Socio-technical approach, seven characteristics of trustworthiness, ethically sound and socially responsible 

## AI RMF and NIST CFS 2.0 Integration

Manage both AI and cybersecurity risk effectively

Telecommunications Industry: service delivery, network reliability

Public Sector: digital governance platforms, societal values

## Risk Assessment and Integration Tools

Risk Assessment Tools: checklists, software applications

Quick Start Guides: Integrate risk information into broader enterprise management

Vulnerability Scanning: Potential targets for penetration testing, patching flaws

## Threat Intelligence and Risk Management

Threat Intelligence Feeds: Sharing of cyber intelligence for proactive detection

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Integration: Align cybersecurity risk management with broader risk strategies

Risk Registers: Centralized document that tracks risks and maintains visibility

## Monitoring and Mitigation Techniques

Profiles & Tiers: Customized profiles to tailor cyber approach, tiers provide maturity for assessing practices

Monitoring & Reporting: Tracking effectiveness of risk management efforts, reports help stay informed on current posture

Risk Mitigation Techniques: regular audits
