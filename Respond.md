## Introduction to RESPOND Function

Mitigating impact of incidents, contain impact

## RESPOND Function Categories

Swiftly counter and regain control over threats

Incident Management (RS.MA): Responses to detected incidents managed

Incident Analysis (RS.AN): Investigations conducted to support forensics/recovery

Incident Response and Communication (RS.CO): Coordinated with internal and external stakeholders

Incident Mitigation (RS.MI):  Activities performed to prevent expansion and mitigate effects

## RESPOND Function Subcategories

Divide each category into more specific outcomes

## Incident Management - (RS.MA-01)

Overview of process to activation of incident response plan, initiate other plans like BC and DC

## Incident Management - (RS.MA-02)

Incident reports are promptly evaluated and validated, urgency/relevancy, authenticity, criteria to estimate severity

## Incident Management - (RS.MA-03)

Assess and validate incident reports, categorize incident

## Incident Management - (RS.MA-04)

Incidents are escalated and elevated, track status

## Incident Management - (RS.MA-05)

Incidents are recovered based on criteria

## Incident Management - Processes

Develop and maintain incident response capability

Maintain Incident Response: Take into account compliances and roles

Designate Personnel to manage incident: Key person to handle, document

Maintain Enterprise process for reporting: reporting timeframes, publicly available to employees

Key roles and responsibilities: key positions for incident responders, legal, human resources

Mechanism for communicating during incident: primary and secondary mechanism (phone, email)

Security incident thresholds: Differentiating between incident and event

## Incident Analysis - (RS.AN-03)

In-depth analysis to determine sequence of events for underlying reasons

## Incident Analysis - (RS.AN-06)

Importance of thorough documentation when investigating to ensure reliable and traceable process

## Incident Analysis - (RS.AN-07)

Meticulous collection of incident data, preserve all pertinent incident data

## Incident Analysis - (RS.AN-08)

Incident responders to allocate resources and develop response strategies

## Incident Analysis Process

Conduct routine incident response exercises: Prepare personnel to respond to real-life incidents, annual basis, test workflow

Conduct post-incident reviews: Identify lessons learned and establish follow-up actions, stronger access control

## Incident Response Reporting and Communication - (RS.CO-02)

Need to notify internal and external stakeholders of incidents, notify all for coordinated response

## Incident Response Reporting and Communication - (RS.CO-03)

Emphasize importance of sharing relevant information with all stakeholders, (ISAC) Information Sharing and Analysis Center

## Incident Response Reporting and Communication Process

Keep contact information for parties that need to be notified, up-to-date yearly

## Incident Mitigation - (RS.MI-01)

Incidents are quickly contained to limit impact, antivirus, transfer compromised endpoints to remediation VLAN

## Incident Mitigation - (RS.MI-02)

Immediate actions taken to minimize impact, neutralize incident
