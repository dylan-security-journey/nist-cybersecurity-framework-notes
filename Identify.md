## IDENTIFY

Understanding organization's current cybersecurity risk before they can start securing ecosystem

Determine improvement opportunities for policies to inform efforts under all six functions

Identify function should be performed before any other function, likely to return to it as organization changes

## IDENTIFY Function: Categories

Asset Management (ID.AM): Assets enabling organization to achieve business purposes are identified, knowing where it is located,
Determining relative importance and protection

Risk Assessment (ID.RA): Risk to the organization is understood

Improvement (ID.IM): Improvements to risk management processes and activities identified across all CSF Functions

## IDENTIFY Function: Subcategories

Subcategories further divide each category into more specific outcomes of technical and management activities

## Asset Management: (ID.AM-01)

Hardware inventory is maintained (entire lifecycle), new hardware, update inventories

## Asset Management: (ID.AM-02)

Ensures inventory that is managed is maintained (software/services/systems)

## Asset Management: (ID.AM-03)

Maintenance of organization's network communication with internal and external data flows, helps map data flows

## Asset Management: (ID.AM-04)

Inventories of services provided by suppliers maintained, streamline supply chain and optimal inventory alignment (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

## Asset Management: (ID.AM-05)

Assets prioritized based on classification/criticality

## Asset Management: (ID.AM-07)

Details inventories of data and metadata maintained

## Asset Management: (ID.AM-08)

Systems/hardware/software managed through entire lifecycle, (deployment > end of life)

## What to Inventory?

Creating an inventory of organization's assets through Configuration Management Database (CMDD), includes everything

Can't protect if you don't know it exist: Physical, software version (licensing), data flows 

## IDENTIFY Function: Tools and Techniques

Maintenance Tools: Diagnostic and repair actions (packet sniffer)

Controlled Maintenance: Scheduling/recording maintenance

Non Local Maintenance: Monitoring and approving non-local maintenance activities

Maintenance Personnel: Maintenance personnel authorization list

Timely Maintenance: Performing preventive/predictive maintenance

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-01)

Vulnerabilities in assets identified, detecting unpatched or misconfigured

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-02)

Threat intelligence is received from sources, (tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs))

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-03)

Internal & external threats are identified, threat hunting to look for signs of threat actors

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-04)

Potential impacts and likelihood of threats exploiting are identified, business and cyber estimate risk scenarios (risk registers)

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-05)

Threats & likelihood are used to determine risk prioritization, (threat models) prioritize resource allocation 

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-06)

Risk responses are chosen from available options (vulnerability management criteria)

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-07)

Configuration change control processes are in place, proposed changes

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-08)

Processes for responding to vulnerability disclosures established

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-09)

Authentication and integrity of hardware/software assessed before use

## Risk Assessment: (ID.RA-10)

Critical suppliers are assessed prior to acquisition

## Improvement: (ID.IM-01)

Improvements identified from evaluations, self-assessments, third-party assessments

## Improvement: (ID.IM-02)

Use contracts to ensure suppliers meeting security requirements, and perform testing response plans

Improvements are identified from security test

## Improvement: (ID.IM-03)

Detection processes are continuously improved, lessons are learned

## Improvement: (ID.IM-04)

Details incident response plans, contingency plans

## Controls and Techniques: Incident Response Life Cycle

Well defined incident response plan assist in detecting incidents rapidly

Preparation for Incident Response: create incident response policy, guidelines of communication & prioritization

Detection and Analysis: Perform initial analysis (automation software like antivirus)

Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: Containing an incident should be predetermined, separate containment strategies

Post-Incident Activity: Hold lesson learned meeting to review effectiveness, follow-up reports

Controls and Techniques: Contingency Plan

Information Protection Processes include contingency planning helping recover quickly (restore disrupted services)

## Controls: Business Continuity Plan

Include multiple plans meant to ensure minimal impact to business functions, includes Incident response plan, disaster recover plan, backup plan, critical processes defined and sustained

## Technique: System Development Life Cycle

Integrating security in every step of your system from initiation, analysis, design, implementation, and disposal 

Initiation: key security roles, storing, transmitting

Development: designed/programmed

Implementation: configure and enable systems, install

Operations: operating/enhancements, control activities

Disposal: Discarding information/hardware
