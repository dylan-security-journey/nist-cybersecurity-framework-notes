Data Security (PR.DS): Data managed consistent with integrity/availability

Platform Security (PR.PS): physical or virtual platforms managed 

Technology Infrastructure Resilience (PR.IR): Security architecture protected and risk strategy aligned

## PROTECT Function Subcategories

Category divided into subcategories for more specific outcomes

## Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control - (PR.AA-01)

Managing identities and credentials for users, only authorized identities, unique identifier

## Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control - (PR.AA-02)

Proofing and binding to credentials, effective controls for verifying, government-issued identity credentials

## Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control - (PR.AA-03)

Authentication of users by implementing strong access controls, MFA , minimum strength pins

## Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control - (PR.AA-04)

Importance of ensuring integrity and security when shared between systems, identity assertions

## Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control - (PR.AA-05)

Least privilege and separation of duties, review access

## Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control - (PR.AA-06)

Implementing appropriate controls to manage physical access to assets (cameras, escort, guards)

## Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control

Multifactor Authentication: Use of two or more factors to authenticate (you know, you have, you are)

Separation of Duties: No users should be given enough privilege to misuse system on their own (no full permission)

Role-Based Access Control: (RBAC) restrict access only to respective roles, based on department or seniority

Privileged Access Management: (PAM) Securely manage privileged accounts, strong password, least privilege

## Awareness and Training - (PR.AT-01)

Required awareness training for individuals and train, mitigate potential threats

## Awareness and Training - (PR.AT-02)

Role-based cybersecurity training, specialized awareness, tailored training

## Awareness and Training Options

Security Awareness Program:  how to interact with data, policies, guidelines, communication

Role-Specific Awareness and Training: skill-based training, specific for role

## Data Security - (PR.DS-01)

Data-at-rest are protected, using encryption/digital signatures of stored data files

## Data Security - (PR.DS-02)

Protection of data while transmitted (data-in-transit) between systems, block personal emails/file sharing

## Data Security - (PR.DS-10)

Protection of data (data-in-use) while processed/utilized, remove data when no longer needed

## Data Security - (PR.DS-11)

Creating backups of data & reliable copies in case of failures, geolocation restrictions for data backup storage

## Data Security Control Options

Encryption: Cryptographic technique where data is encoded and indecipherable

Transport Layer Security (TLS): Helps secure transmitted data using encryption, between a client and server

Automated Backups: In-scope enterprise assets, running backups frequently, test recovery

## Platform Security - (PR.PS-01)

Establishing policies to ensure proper configuration, hardened baselines 

## Platform Security - (PR.PS-02)

Perform patches and updates ensuring no outdated or vulnerable software

## Platform Security - (PR.PS-03)

Removal of hardware when it can't support security capabilities, end-of-life maintenance

## Platform Security - (PR.PS-04)

Availability of log records for monitoring, log generators 

## Platform Security - (PR.PS-05)

Preventing installation of unauthorized software, verify source

## Platform Security - (PR.PS-06)

Secure software development practices 

## Platform Security Options

Baseline Configurations: specifications for information systems

Secure Configuration Process: Maintain secure configuration process

Allowlist: Ensure only authorized software can execute, permitted to be installed

## Technology Infrastructure Resilience - (PR.IR-01)

Protecting networks and environments from unauthorized logical access

## Technology Infrastructure Resilience - (PR.IR-02)

Protecting IT assets from environmental threats (flood, fires)

## Technology Infrastructure Resilience - (PR.IR-03)

Implementing mechanisms to achieve resilience requirements in adverse situations, load balancing, avoid single point failures

## Technology Infrastructure Resilience - (PR.IR-04)

Maintains adequate resource capacity, monitor usage of power/storage

## Technology Infrastructure Resilience Controls

Failsafe: Alerting operator to provide instructions during failure conditions

Load Balancing: Distribute incoming network traffic across servers

Eliminating Single Points of Failure: Fault-tolerant infrastructures, provide redundant components to remain available
