## The DETECT Function

Timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, support successful incident response

## Detect Function Categories

Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM): all assets monitored to find anomalies

Adverse Event Analysis (DE.AE): potentially adverse events analyzed

## Detect Function Subcategories

Outcome driven statements, creating or improving detect functions

## Continuous Monitoring - (DE.CM-01)

Procedures for detecting indicators, wired/wireless networks monitored

## Continuous Monitoring - (DE.CM-02)

Critical control measures to physical environment, badge readers
 
## Continuous Monitoring - (DE.CM-03)

Monitor personnel activity/technology usage to ensure compliance, failed access attempts

## Continuous Monitoring - (DE.CM-06)

Monitoring external service provider's activities when reliant on external services

## Continuous Monitoring - (DE.CM-09)

Monitoring of computing hardware/software (email/web/file sharing)

## Continuous Monitoring Tools

Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR): Monitor endpoints like servers and computers for suspicious activities

Threat Intelligence: Leverage feeds to stay informed on known threats

Automated Investigation & Response: Automated workflows to investigate incidents

Advanced Hunting: Proactively searching for signs of malicious activity

Integration with Other Security Solutions: Coordinating with other security tools to enhance detection

## Adverse Event Analysis - (DE.AE-02)

Reviewing and analyzing events for indication of unusual activity, (SIEM), review log events

## Adverse Event Analysis - (DE.AE-03)

Correlating information from multiple sources to enhance security, correlate events among log sources

## Adverse Event Analysis - (DE.AE-04)

Understanding impact and scope of adverse events, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), estimate impact

## Adverse Event Analysis - (DE.AE-06)

Communication about events internally to authorized personnel, generated alerts to SOC, ticketing system

## Adverse Event Analysis - (DE.AE-07)

Integration of threat intelligence into analysis process, informed decisions

## Adverse Event Analysis - (DE.AE-08)

Process for declaring incidents when adverse events meet incident criteria (severity, impact), known false positives

## Adverse Event Analysis Techniques

Conducting periodic threat analysis: Determining likelihood of breach

All-source intelligence in analysis: Available information on cyber threat environment (open-source)

Advances automation: machine learning to assist SOC or CIRT in volume of information

## Adverse Event Analysis Tools

Incident Reporting Systems: Allow individuals to provide valuable data for analysis

Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Identifying underlying causes of events, Event description > Cause Identification > Cause Determination > Recommendations

Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA): Proactive risk assessment, identify potential failures, assess impact, determine likelihood, prioritization
