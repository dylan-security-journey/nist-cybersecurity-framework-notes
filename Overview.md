## Growing Security Threat In World

All organizations have things in common like storing, sharing data

Threats to the IT landscape include:
Malicious Actors: goal is for financial gain
Insider Threats: employees misuse validated access (sometimes not intentional)
Third party vendors: giving third party users access to the system
Malware: software designed to harm IT environment through viruses or malware
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service): overwhelming IT networks to disrupt IT services

## Need for structure

Structured approach builds efficiency and helps governance

Four key reasons:
Understand and prioritize cyber threats  to know what attacks are most relevant
Minimize risk across organization because focusing on the most significant attack will help to know what to mitigate and improve productivity
Improves Cyber Governance as NIST can help make sure business goals align with cyber strategies as well as compliances and accountability
Cultivating communication and integration more smoothly whether it's internal or external for risk management strategies

## NIST Framework

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) U.S. Department of Commerce federal agency

It helps charter a national standard for business and industry innovation

Developing standards and frameworks that define security and privacy controls

Originally used to protect U.S. infrastructure but has been adopted by public and private organizations to optimize security solutions

Executed through U.S. Presidential Executive Order 13636 (2013)

NIST 1.0 released in (2014) Nist 2.0 released in (2024)

## Transition from NIST 1.0 > 2.0 

1.0 targeted for U.S. government infrastructure

2.0 created to broaden for organizational types worldwide (clear language) (new SCRM tools = supply chain)

## NIST 2.0 Components

Arranged among three components: Tiers, Core, Profile

Tiers are a method to assess how well an organization current cybersecurity risk management practices achieve the outcomes in framework Core

Set of cybersecurity outcomes arranged by function, category, subcategory

Profiles are used to outline organization's existing and intended cybersecurity stance measured by outcomes of Core Framework

The Core Identify, Protect, and Govern functions apply before a cybersecurity breach is encountered. 

The Detect, Respond, Recover and Govern post incident review functions apply after the breach is discovered.

## NIST 2.0 Implementation Example

Provides high level outcomes of proper cybersecurity but doesn't prescribe how outcomes should be achieved

Offer implementation examples to provide clarity which is guided by Core function category and subcategory

## NIST Core Functions

Govern: risk management strategy and policies, actions to achieve

Identify: informing actions, data, assets, IT systems, people, risk, processes, plans, practices

Protect: cybersecurity threats, mitigate risk to data, security practices, firewalls, access controls

Detect: identify threats, early warning system, rapid detections, incident response

Respond: Action plan, detected cybersecurity incident, contain the effects, incident management, mitigation, reporting

Recover: Restoring capabilities, rebuilding phase, timely, prioritized restoration

## 2.0 Functions: Categories and Subcategories

Core functions outline project outcome definitions

Definitions are divided into categories and subcategories providing detailed scope of implementing objectives for solution

Categories: cover general cybersecurity objectives for organization (dividing function into actionable segments aligned to Core outcomes)

Subcategories: divide categories into specific outcomes for management implementation. Each Subcategory offering suggestions on how to achieve desired outcome.

## Case Study of Core Function Implementation

Prioritize Solution Requirements = business objectives, identify all assets, assess existing systems

Define current cybersecurity posture = current practices, structure for analysis

Perform Risk Assessment = potential impact of threat, analyzing what went wrong in past incidents
